        @par

        The corridor is loaded with a path, usually obtained from a #dtNavMeshQuery::findPath() query. The corridor
        is then used to plan local movement, with the corridor automatically updating as needed to deal with inaccurate
        agent locomotion.

        Example of a common use case:

        -# Construct the corridor object and call #init() to allocate its path buffer.
        -# Obtain a path from a #dtNavMeshQuery object.
        -# Use #reset() to set the agent's current position. (At the beginning of the path.)
        -# Use #setCorridor() to load the path and target.
        -# Use #findCorners() to plan movement. (This handles dynamic path straightening.)
        -# Use #movePosition() to feed agent movement back into the corridor. (The corridor will automatically adjust as needed.)
        -# If the target is moving, use #moveTargetPosition() to update the end of the corridor.
           (The corridor will automatically adjust as needed.)
        -# Repeat the previous 3 steps to continue to move the agent.

        The corridor position and target are always constrained to the navigation mesh.

        One of the difficulties in maintaining a path is that floating point errors, locomotion inaccuracies, and/or local
        steering can result in the agent crossing the boundary of the path corridor, temporarily invalidating the path.
        This class uses local mesh queries to detect and update the corridor as needed to handle these types of issues.

        The fact that local mesh queries are used to move the position and target locations results in two beahviors that
        need to be considered:

        Every time a move function is used there is a chance that the path will become non-optimial. Basically, the further
        the target is moved from its original location, and the further the position is moved outside the original corridor,
        the more likely the path will become non-optimal. This issue can be addressed by periodically running the
        #optimizePathTopology() and #optimizePathVisibility() methods.

        All local mesh queries have distance limitations. (Review the #dtNavMeshQuery methods for details.) So the most accurate
        use case is to move the position and target in small increments. If a large increment is used, then the corridor
        may not be able to accurately find the new location.  Because of this limiation, if a position is moved in a large
        increment, then compare the desired and resulting polygon references. If the two do not match, then path replanning
        may be needed.  E.g. If you move the target, check #getLastPoly() to see if it is the expected polygon.

        This is the function used to plan local movement within the corridor. One or more corners can be
        detected in order to plan movement. It performs essentially the same function as #dtNavMeshQuery::findStraightPath.

        Due to internal optimizations, the maximum number of corners returned will be (@p maxCorners - 1)
        For example: If the buffers are sized to hold 10 corners, the function will never return more than 9 corners.
        So if 10 corners are needed, the buffers should be sized for 11 corners.
