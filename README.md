# DotRecast
DotRecast is a port of recast4j(https://github.com/ppiastucki/recast4j) to C# and has been built to target netstandard2.1 to work with both Unity3D and pure C#.

If you're using Unity3D, the following projects have been modified to build with netstandard2.1:

- DotRecast.Core
- DotRecast.Recast
- DotRecast.Detour
- DotRecast.Detour.Crowd
- DotRecast.Detour.Dynamic
- DotRecast.Detour.Extras
- DotRecast.Detour.TileCache

 Please feel free to copy and use these projects in Unity3D. We plan to continue improving them as time goes on.
